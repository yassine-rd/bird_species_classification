# About Dataset

[BIRDS 400](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) is a dataset of 400 bird species. 58388 training images, 2000 test images (5 images per species) 
and 2000 validation images (5 images per species. 

This is a very high quality dataset where 
there is only one bird in each image and the bird typically takes up at least 50% of the 
pixels in the image. As a result, even a moderately complex model will achieve training and 
test accuracies in the mid 80% range. All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color images in jpg format. 
Data set includes a train set, test set and validation set. Each set contains 400 sub directories, one for each bird species.

In our case, we have chosen 100 classes among the 400 in the database in order to speed up the learning process for our models
