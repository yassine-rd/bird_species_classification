# Bird recognition using deep learning-based methods

## Abstract
We haven't seen any bird species in our area in recent days, and even if we do, determining the bird's species is tough. From the perspective of a human being, the appearance of the bird varies in terms of shape, size, colour, and other factors. The most efficient approach to recognise the birds is to understand about them through photographs.
